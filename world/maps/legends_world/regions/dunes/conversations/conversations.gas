One of these Pyramids is suppose to go to hell and the other to heaven, but it's hell also. If you go in a straight line northeast you'll eventually stumble onto a wreck of a town called Grescal. Though you've probably already been there. So I needn't go on about the tourist attractions there or the lack of. If you go in a straight line anywhere else you'll eventually stumble into something or other, and if you follow that you'll eventually end up somewhere or other that you may recognize. Otherwise you'll end up going in circles and end up like poor Bareld here. Well have a pleasant stroll. Please don't bother sending a postcard, the mail delivery's absolutely shocking out here.";
