Entry is free, but perhaps before you go in you may be interested in some pop corn and coke? You never know, you may get a little hungry in there. As they say a little preparation goes a long way. And why my grocery bill is really low, those calcium tablets cost a bucket way out here. So go on buy something why don't ya. It's not like your strapped for cash now is it? Roll up, roll up, roll up, the main event is ready to start soon.";
