They achieved their aim, even if they're not alive to see it. They vowed that if they couldn't accede to their birthright and rule all of Aranna, then nobody or nothing would. They vowed that they would release the gates of Hell! And now that gate's open! All the ancient evils are returning to Aranna. Prepare yourself, hero. No matter how long you fight for and whatever you achieve, It'll never be over!";

New monsters have been released through the Breaking of the Seals that have kept the Ancient Utraeans in their prison for so long. Will the Krug become extinct? What will the Hassats do in these new lands and what of the Zaurask. Will they eventually drive the Kingdom into near extinction like they did the Ancient Utraeans all those long years ago?. Now all these questions can be answered in the singleplayer game! No longer will Veteran & Elite be the precinct of multiplayer players only. If you have knowledge of how to use the Dungeon Siege Toolkit, you can transfer your singleplayer party into special Veteran & Elite versions of this map. See the included documentation of how to use this feature. I hope you have had fun with this special version of the Utraean Peninsula Map.";
