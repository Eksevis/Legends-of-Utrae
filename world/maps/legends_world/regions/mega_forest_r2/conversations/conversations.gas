The Evil that you are about to face has been imprisoned for over 3000 years and has been attempting to break it's bonds ever since. We helped the survivors of the fall of the Utraeans to imprison this Evil and designed the 8 Key Stones to lock it away, for the conflict drained most of our powers and the Evil couldn't be defeated back then. Yet it must be confronted in it's very lair and defeated before it manages to escape and destroy us all. For that very reason the Key Stones were constructed and hidden so that only the most resourcefull and powerfull of all heroes could ever hope to find them all. Any lesser hero would fail at the final hurdle and let our foes escape. Only the one who can find all 8 Stones would be able to win the battle that is about to unfold. That hero is you. We, the Elves, could only watch from a distance and lend what help we could, you are the one who must do this deed. Therefore take the Hiroth Townstone to Priest Kavaran at Hiroth and assemble all 8 Stones, ready for the final battle. Good Luck and Godspeed to you.";
