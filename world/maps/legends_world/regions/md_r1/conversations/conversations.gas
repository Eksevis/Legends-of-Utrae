I came down here for adventure and got stuck when the elevator stopped working. I've been down here so long that the flesh has rotted off my bones and my eyeballs have fallen out. WHAT, IT WAS A BUG! AND THEY FIXED IT IN THE PATCH! Waaaaah, I knew I should have patched my game but I kept putting it off. WHAT! LEGENDS OF ARANNA is out! I must get that. AND DUNGEON SIEGE 2 IS DUE EARLY NEXT YEAR. Wait, will you please take me with you. I don't need much feeding anymore and you can keep all the gold & treasure we find. I just what to finish this game so I can play Legends of Aranna before Dungeon Siege 2 comes out.";
