I couldn't take any more of that dimwitted apprentice of mine, Flessen, so I set off for parts unknown - That is, to Lang, if it hasn't sunk into the stinking swamp by now. You understand, I'm sure, the lengths to which one will travel in the name of duty and honor. Anyhow, I set off with the Fallraen Snowflake stone, so as to gather the Lang Mosquito stone and carry them both to the Circle in Hiroth. All the Society's Townstones must be assembled to access the Ancient Armory, you know. I suppose I took a wrong turn somehwere in this dratted ice field, and ended up face to face with a horde of toothy bumbles.";

In fact, since you are so adept at vivifying stupid old historians, maybe you'd be willing to take the Fallraen Townstone to Lang yourself? I'm not so spry as I used to be, and I really shouldn't stay away from Apprentice Flessen for so long. The magicatorium is likely burnt to the ground by now from his fumblings. I haven't much but this is sure to be usefull to you on your journey. I'm just going to rest up for a bit before heading back.";
