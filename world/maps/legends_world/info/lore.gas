       //1. Journal excerpt by Relran, guard to Lord Hovart: given by Elddim Guard Captain

      {
		description = "Threb the 3rd, 1017 \n\n I've entered into the employment of one Lord Hovart. From what the other guards say, Sir Hovart has been the Liege Lord of these parts for fifty years. Seems he's of royal blood, though you couldn't tell by looking at him. Queen's cousin or some such. He's of average build, dark eyes, dark hair, impeccably dressed. The others tell me to watch my step around him; as he's known for flying into a rage without any provocation, but so far, he's been nothing but charming.\n\nThreb the 18th, 1017 \n\n Slogged through the newly excavated tunnels today. Hovart claims he is building some sort of underground fortress. I tried to tell him I didn't sign on to dig pits, but he just laughed. I guess I can't complain too much. At least he was down there working just as hard as the rest of us, getting his white frock coat all muddy. But still, I'm a fighting man, not a mine monkey. The men don't seem to think this work'll last long. There's a wager going on how many days more it'll last afore Hovart gets bored. But I don't know. He seems awfully determined... Elbert Nolan, who's been with Hovart's contingent for the last ten years, says Hovart engages in these sort of projects at least twice a year. None of them are ever finished though. Seems accurate; I've come across the oddest contraptions grown dusty in some of the unused rooms. \n\nFoth the 1st, 1017 \n\n Work continues at breakneck pace. No one's wagering anymore. Not since SHE arrived. We all knew Hovart had been courting an exotic dark Lady from another land. I'd caught glimpses of her once or twice; not what I'd call beautiful, but certainly striking in a chilling sort of way. We knew that Hovart had found a bride, and that she had insisted on living in an underground palace. Which explains why, out of all the masses of unfinished projects Hovart began, we're actually close to completing this one. Lady Sathar arrived yesterday with much fanfare, driving a column of spiders and wild beasts before her. Even now, I can hear the scratches and skitters of her 'pets' as she calls them. Spiders! I have a bad feeling about this. The Lady is not natural, I don't think, no human is that...cold. \n\nManarz the 9th, 1018 \n\n Been a few months since I've had privacy enough to write. The stronghold is complete, and the spiders, scratch that, 'White Mothers,' as the Lady insists we call them, have started producing silk. Lord Hovart has been behaving even more oddly than usual. Frequently stops speaking mid sentence, as if distracted by some otherworldly matter. His very flesh has started changing, darkening, as if he weren't quite there... The Lady and he have been conferring with that Dwarven zealot, Mage Umberdeep. They are afraid of the peasants for some reason. Something about the fragility of the latest experiment, and how everything depends on it. Why so much secrecy? The raids on the mines have been successful, thanks to Umberdeep's enchantments, and the artifact will be completed by sunset and placed in the ancient crypt for safekeeping, they say. What that means, I haven't a clue, but we have been instructed to bolt the outer doors and allow no one in or out.\n\nSmoth the 30th, 1019 \n\n Blackness is my world. The Lord and Lady have dissapeared. Only the inner circle have the means to reach the outside world, and they only leave to bring back whichever peasants were unwise enough to be lurking around the outer domes. The White Mothers are hungry again. The White Mothers are always hungry. Those who serve the Mothers are no longer...among the living. Only the Lady and her barbaric people are safe from the Mothers' poison. We unlucky humans die painful deaths, only to rise and live again as something evil. Even now my hand is shriveled and dry. When the Mage's artifact is found and the doors are opened once more, humanity will be doomed.";

Within a hundred years of its introduction, over sixty villages in the Empire supported thriving communities of devout Azunite worshippers.\n\nThe simple Azunite doctrine of worldly rewards for hard labor was far easier to understand than the abstract, often unrewarding worship of the distant Stellar Emperors. Followers had only to profess a belief in the strength of The Defender and pass formally beneath his sacred shield, and they were accepted as a member of his clan. \n\nIt is believed that rare offspring of devout Azunite worshippers are 'Marked with fire' in secret ceremonies. Those children have been known to receive mortal wounds only to be resurrected by simple passage beneath the sacred shield.";

		description = "The hassats were originally genetically manipulated by the ancient Utraeans for the sole purpose of slave labor. Later they became popular as entertainers in huge gladiatorial contests involving up to 1000 hassats, often forced to fight with their native claws and teeth. Years of such torment served the hassats well when Utraean society disintegrated due to internal revolution and civil unrest. \n\nPractically overnight the Utraeans were wiped out when their previously docile hassat and zaurask slaves took advantage of the infighting between the Utraean hard-liners and the more moderate parts of their society who felt that the Utraean's suppression and manipulation of lesser races would lead to their destruction. The totalitarian leadership was overthrown and placed into a place of exile, but by now it was too late for the Utraeans. The surviving Utraeans fled to a remote enclave, leaving behind only ruins of their formerly majestic cities. Their former slaves, the hassats and zaurask, had to fend for themselves. \n\nToday the hassat are to be found migrating far from their former homes, forced out by the threat of extinction through the hands of the more prolific and powerful zaurask. In the Utraean Peninsula the hassats have found similar conditions to their native habitats, with colonies being formed from both migrating hassats and those that survived the overthrow of the Utraeans on the peninsula by living in the remote forests far from the lands populated by the Droog. \n\nAs their numbers increased, they began to encrouch on territories once populated by the Krug. Now the Krug are being forced to move out of the forests into the lands inhabited by the descendants of the 2nd Legion. War has errupted.";

Ironically this proved to be their downfall, as when the internal revolt took place between Utraean factions, the zaurask and hassats rose up in rebellion. Though untold thousands of zaurask and hassats died in the fighting, they overwhelming outnumbered the Utraeans and furthermore due to the Utraeans reliance on them, they were to be found everywhere in Utraean society. \n\nToo late the Utraeans realised the grave mistake that they have made and even though they overthrew and exiled their former leaders, it was too late to appease their former slaves. The survivors fled their former heartland to a distant island. \n\nFreed from their former masters, the zaurask and hassats immediately began to fight amongst themselves. While individually there wasn't much difference in power and ferocity between the species, the Zaurask were an older and more resilient breed. They were also more fertile and for each Zaurask that fell in battle, 3 more would be hatched. \n\nFacing extinction, the hassat survivors fled to remote forests around Aranna, leaving the Zaurask in control of much of the former Utraean Empire. Now Zaurask are slowing but surely spreading to other regions of Aranna. One such region is the Utraean Peninsula found on the very edge of the continent of Aranna. There can only be one outcome when the Zaurask encounter the remnants of the 10th Legion of the Empire of Stars.";

Yet is this so strange, Elves have always been present but choose not to always reveal themselves. The fact that the Elves have chosen now to reveal themselves could only mean that a great disaster is waiting to happen. \n\nIt is rumoured that the Elves had a part to play in the downfall of the ancient Utraeans. While there must be a lot of doubt on such a claim, and it will never be proven one way or the other, the Elves certainly would have felt a lot of justification in participating in the overthrow of the Utraeans. The genetic manipulation and slavery of the lesser races must be terribly abhorrent to the Elves, with their devotion to the Natural Order. It is doubtful that the Elves and the Utraeans could have ever had anything in common. \n\nYet the Elves react quite favourably to the humans, descendants of the Empire of Stars, even though they must seem terribly chaotic to the disciplined Elves, and some of their practices must offend their love of Nature. This is contrary to the reaction of the Droog, Seck and Goblins, who seem unable to distinguish between normal humans and the Utraeans. The hassats and zaurask are even more violent, seeing humans as nothing more than unadorned Utraeans, therefore enemies to be exterminated where possible. Elves, being long-lived beings as they are, would know the truth. \n\nIf Elves are prepared to offer the hand of friendship and assistance, it would be very foolish to turn them down. While they'll never intervene directly, they'll also not offer help and instead stay back and manipulate events from a distance like the Utraeans do. Elvish offer of assistance could only mean they deem the situation urgent.";

By nature the Droc aren't migratory, instead they are very territorial and loath for change. They are also very resistant to genetic manipulation, as the ancient Utraeans found out. Being a very old and stubborn race, the Droc are totally unsuitable as subjects for such experiments. After finding out that the only result of the experiments on the Droc was to increase their strength and natural ferocity, the Utraeans abandoned this line of research and released the surviving Droc into various parts of Aranna in order to monitor the disruptions caused to the existing species by this intrusion. \n\nOne such release point was close to the southern stronghold of the Droog, Quillrabe. Until recently the Peninsula Droc have been restricted to a small area, until a landslide opened up a route to the more hospitable river canyon just below Quillrabe. Already the Droog have had to surrender vast areas of the lower canyon plains to the intruders. \n\nWhile not armored, the Droc have extremely tough skin and a high tolerance to pain. Indeed the Droog's arrows only seems to send them into a violent rage, much to the consternation of the Droog. Luckily the Droc need to live close to a source of their food supply, which consists of algae & plankton, otherwise the Droog's very survival could be under threat.";

When the 10th Legion made Ehb its home, the Droog were resentful and helped engineer the Seck Rebellion in order to try to force the newcomers out. They still have bad memories of being manipulated by the ancient Utraeans, a major reason for the Droog now being such unreliable emissaries. By nature the Droog are a law abiding and religious race, but numerous betrayals and exploitations by the Utraeans have made them deceitful and untrustworthy. To them the newcomers appear as a new form of their ancient adversaries, as the new humans have smooth skins like the Utraeans, except they aren't adorned or grey in colour. Therefore they aren't worthy of being treated with dignity and respect. \n\nLately the Droog have come under attack from a new threat, the Droc. These creatures have no interest in communicating, and so can't be swayed by the Droog's smooth tongue and trade merchandise. All they are interested in is a place to live, which unfortunately means removing a few Droog along the way. The Droog's arrows and swords have little impact against their thick skin and serves little but to enrage them. They are also extremely quick and can easily outmanoeuvre the slower Droog, yet are smart enough not to fall for obvious traps. The Droog have been forced back to their ancient fortress city of Quillrabe. Will this be the end of this ancient race?";

From their strongholds in the fetid swamps of Gonsiir and the Dark Swamps around Lang, Goblins have plotted unceasingly to drive humanity from Western Aranna. Ingenious artificers of magic, Goblins have created many mechanisms of death and mayhem, and it is said they gleefully provided their services to hasten the fall of the ancient Empire of Stars. \n\nThankfully for Ehb, their enmity for each other is nearly as legendary as their hatred for humanity. Constant blood feuds within their confederacy have thus far prevented them from posing any serious risk to the welfare of the kingdom other than the recent events in Northern Ehb, where the bravery of a great hero prevented a great tragedy. \n\nThe relationship of the Goblins and the Utraeans was a more amicable one than any of the others the ancient Utraeans were involved in. The Utraeans had no interest in the Goblins' caves under the swamps, the damp and dark environment didn't agree with their already pale complexions. The Goblins, as always, were interested in conquering the entire world but could never maintain harmony long enough amongst themselves to make this an achievable reality. Therefore they weren't a threat to the Utraeans, who in any case believed that they could easily wipe out the Goblins any time they pleased. They however had things they could trade with each other. The Goblins were desperate for Utraean technology and machines. The Utraeans were interested in willing hosts for their genetic experiments. \n\nThe Goblins were enthusiastic with this prospect as they believed that they could use the resultant hybrids to betray the Utraeans and conquer the world. In any case the genetic misfits that resulted were unsuitable to be controlled by either the Goblins or the Utraeans. \n\nOnce the Utraean Civilization collapsed, the Goblins were left to plot secret little plans of global domination alone in their dark, dank caves. They did do a little trading for raw materials necessary to patch up their machines, otherwise the putrid swamp water would seep into their caves and drown the lot of them. Only in one moment of their history has an exceptional Goblin been born that could unite them into one purpose. \n\nUnfortunately for them, their colony under the Dark Swamps of the Utraean Peninsula has no such leader. However they are still an unpredictable and violent race and venturing unannounced into their lairs is a risky endeavour.";

Under their 500 year rule the Utraeans lost all compassion and dignity that they once possessed. They sought knowledge and comfort above all else. Nothing was forbidden to them. They felt they owned everything and therefore they had the right to do whatever they pleased. Other races only existed to be used and as it was too much trouble to conquer and enslave them, slaves would instead be genetically modified from lesser species therefore creating no prospect of resentment or rebellion. \n\nThere was a sizable minority who opposed this but felt it was too much trouble to change things. When the pursuit of the perfect slave failed due to genetic imperfections, the Utraeans performed the act that brought about their downfall. They began to experiment on themselves, first in secret and then more openly. To this the sizable apathetic minority turned into a vocal majority, more with the fear of what may become of them rather than anything else. Utraean society began to collapse with internal dissent and civil unrest. \n\nThen the unthinkable happened and the previously docile hassat and zaurask slaves erupted in open revolt. The Utraean Leadership was quickly captured, tried and sent to eternal exile and the Eight Key Stones hidden all over Aranna, for one day there'll have to be a reckoning, for the last thing the Exiled Utraeans did was to vow to destroy all of Aranna. They certainly have the power to do so.";

They peer from the darkness, gaping at our mastery of fire, terrified by our magic-their minds too dim to gasp what is common sense to a child. Their culture is a mosaic of traditions from other civilizations, and they communicate primarily with grunts and gestures. The Krug consider themselves inferior to the mysterious and often feuding gods who stride the earth, directing their destinies. If not for the forbearance and mercy of other races, the Krug might long ago have become extinct. \n\nAlthough not inherently evil, the Krug all too often are used as tools of darkness. In exchange for their unquestioning obedience, malvolent races sometimes give them basic instruction in sorcery and tradecrafts-skills the Krug are incapable of developing on their own. The Droog  tolerated them and even the Utraeans mostly ignored them, except for periodic culls when their numbers got too great. The Krug were too simple minded to be much use in the Utraeans' genetic experiments, with all results being failures. \n\nIndeed once one great Utraean leader decided to exterminate the entire Krug population and nearly succeeded too. Yet within several years the Krug were as populous as before, and no attempt has been made since. \n\nDespite this the current Krugs are facing such a prospect. Something is forcing them from the Forests and Upper Plains into the lower River Plains settled by the 10th Legion, and thus into conflict with the human inhabitants. \n\nThere have been conflicts before between the Krug and the settlers, most recently the uprising in the northern provinces of Ehb. But most of these have been orchestrated by the Droog or the Goblins. This one is different, the Krug are absolutely terrified of something and would sooner perish at the hands of men than stay and fight in their former enclaves. \n\nWhatever they are fleeing from must be extremely powerful and only the foolish would venture into the Great Northern Forest without proper preparations.";

The only thing that these Krug have in common with Goblins is a preference to inhabit dark underground tunnels and caves. \n\nYet there could be a disturbing reminder here of the distant past. Just as the Hassats and Zaurask were genetically modified species, the Degenerative Krug could very well be failed experiments of the Utraeans on the true Goblins. It is well known that the Goblins willingly participated in these experiments in return for access to Utraean technology. If this is true the implications are obvious. The Krug themselves must be descendants of failed Utraean experiments on Goblins. After all it has been suggested through archaeology study on the Krug that they are a very young race that didn't exist in Utraean times, but have existed for the entire history of humanity. \n\nThe alternative is even more disturbing. The Goblins were interested enough in the Utraean genetic research to allow themselves to be subjected to it, and obtained Utraean technology in return. And they are always searching for ways to overcome their adversity to sunlight. The archaeologists can't be certain just when the Krug first emerged as a distinct species, other than it was sometime between the fall of the Utraeans and the discovery of the land that would someday become known as the Kingdom of Ehb in the late 5th century. \n\nThe Goblins certainly would have no moral problems in subjecting themselves to such experiments if they thought it would help them in their crusade to one day issue forth from their burrows and lairs to conqueror the world. Such an elaborate scheme would require far more cooperation and organization than normally exists in fragmented Goblin society, but only recently a Goblin was born who was capable of that and only the heroic exploits of a humble farmer was able to stop him conquering the Kingdom of Ehb with his robotic army. Such intellectual Goblins must certainly have be born at frequent intervals in their past as well.";

If not for the catastrophic intervention of the War of Legions, the Empire might well have lived to fulfill its darkest dreams, the domination of the entire globe. Some scribes argue that it still may, and that in no true sense did the Empire ever really fall.\n\nThe resting place of its last Emperor, Veransk III, has never been found, and most of the gruesome stories of his vivisection by the Legions can be traced back to the errant ramblings of retired Imperial soldiers.

The Empire they were sworn to serve was gone and brawling in the ranks was becoming endemic. 'Under all the stars, there is nothing more wretched than a soldier without an enemy to fight,' a frustrated fifty-two year old Noanni wrote in the annals. 'I've had enough of blood that a hectare of soil, a spade, and mule will content me well until my end, if it must, but what am I to do with these youths of fire?'\n\nOn the first day of the new year, addressing a freezing and apprehensive assembly of his men, Karese Noanni declared that the 10th Legion as they knew it could no longer survive. Food supplies were dwindling, a shortage of farmers and an overabundance of Legionaires primarily at fault. If they were to capitalize on their good fortune, it would mean dismantling everything they had ever known and constructing a new kingdom to withstand the ravages of time.\n\nImmediately, there were calls for Noanni to assume the newly proposed throne of Ehb, but he graciously declined, saying the new Kingdom of Ehb would still need an army, and it was his intention to lead it through the difficult times ahead. Refugees from other parts of the Empire were already presenting themselves, seeking shelter from the chaos on the Plain of Tears.

One of my men discovered evidence of this and I reported it to my local commander, who assured me that action would be taken. \n\nSoon after my patrol was ordered to investigate a disturbance in these caverns. Not long after entering the caverns there was a roar of a cave-in and we were trapped. As we began making our way through the caverns to the other entrance the men began complaining of nausea and intense itching of the body. \n\nWe made camp that night and next morning several of the men were missing and the rest were suffering severe cramps and fever.

Just as certain is the fact that the Seck are cold, merciless and even cruel beings which are extremely deadly foes. \n\nMany myths exist that there is a strong link between the Seck & the ancient Utraeans. Some even say that the Seck are the ethereal bodies of the ancient Utraeans that refuse to die and instead cling to life in a form of eternal undeath. Certainly there are some resemblances in the features of the Seck and the few hieroglyphs that exist of the ancient Utraeans. Certainly the bodies of the Seck are consumed by fire and disappear shortly after death, but to actually imply that the Seck are descended from the Utraeans is surely ludicrous. \n\nMore important is the fact that the Seck were able to break free from the magical bonds that bounded them in their eternal prison. Only the brave heroics of a mighty hero was able to prevent the Seck from destroying the Kingdom of Ehb from a place totally unexpected-from within the walls of Castle Ehb itself.

The true origin of Gargoyles was a mystery even to the Utraeans, for they were totally unlike normal creatures of flesh & blood. Composed entirely of stone, Gargoyles were undoubtedly alive but had no form of culture or even awareness of themselves.\n\nIt was generally presumed that Gargoyles were the constructs of an ancient civilization, even older than the Utraeans, created as undying guardians of secret places & dungeons. As such they were ideally suited since they would follow the instructions of their masters, even if those masters have long since past from the world.\n\nThe attractions of sentient Gargoyles to the Utraeans were obvious. They should have made perfect slaves since they require no sustenance or sleep and would obey instructions without question.\n\nImagine then the surprise of the Utraean scientists when their Gargoyle slaves proved contrary & reluctant servants which preferred to spend their time trying to discover such abstract things as culture & awareness of art & beauty! Thus therefore research into Gargoyle genetic manipulation was halted just as Gargoyles began to emerge as a distinct sentient species capable of self-awareness & a high degree of culture.\n\nThe sentient Gargoyles were destroyed or hunted into exile and thus the opportunity for them to gain a higher plane of existance was lost for ever.

A testament also of the dangers of an unlimited thirst of power and how such power can strike down the hands of it's user.\n\nWhile many races inhabited the continent of Aranna, four races eventually came to pre-eminence. Yes the Droog were influential, the Goblins scheming & plotting and the Seck ever dangerous, but all of these were only minor regional races that could only aspire to the glories of the big four. These were the Elves, masters of lore & nature, Dwarves, masters of inventions & machines, Half-Giants, masters of power & order, and the Utraeans, masters of deceit & treachery.\n\nFrom an insignificant tribe of nomads that inhabited the steppes & valleys of the Utraean Peninsula, the Utraeans eventually became the most powerful, influential yet corrupt & evil race that ever existed. Maybe it was their difficult early life that shaped the way they approached the world later on in their dominion, or maybe they secretly resented all others for possessing values & skills that they lacked, the Utraeans eventually came to believe all other races & beings inferior to themselves and came to fear their own mortality.\n\nIn the beginning the tribe of Utrea created a culture consisting of much borrowed from the other races, a mechanized, orderly, naturalistic society that was still less than it's parts. Abandoning its nomadic ways, the Utraeans settled in the vast fertile plains south of the Mesa Desert at the very point of the Peninsula. It was at this point that a monumental discovery was made that allowed the Utraeans to suddenly become the most powerfull race ever known. What or where this discovery was made is unclear, but it is theorized that it was in the small area of southern Utrea that was still partially desert, south-east of the Mesa desert.\n\n\The Utraeans achieved a state where they could control nearly all matter, both living or inanimate. Vast cities were built and many wonders constructed, including the Utraean Basiculus. Their population increased dramatically and all other races came under their dominion. This lasted nearly 3 thousand years.\n\nIronically the more powerful the Utraeans became, the less content they were with their lot. They became fearful and resentful of their own mortality, believing themselves next to gods. They began to experiment with genetic manipulation of living matter, seeking a cure to their mortality. They also became lazy and enslaved many beings to serve them but were ever fearful of rebellion, so they also tried to create the perfect slaves that would be unquestionably obedient to their commands.\n\n The other three major races were overwhelming overmatched and withdrew into safe havens, waiting for the final battle which would determine their fate. The Elves withdrew into the vast Great Northern Forest, the Dwarves into their underground cities beneath northern & eastern Utrae, and the Half-Giants to their Island home. Then something happened that even the Utraeans couldn't anticipate.\n\nA vast civil war broke out amongst the Utraeans, which then turned into rebellion. However not rebellion from without, rather from within. The Zaurask & Hassats that were genetically created to be docile, obedient slaves, suddenly seized on the opportunity granted to them. Showing unbridled fury that was supposed to have been erased from them, the Zaurasks & Hassats tore the Utraean Empire asunder. Seeing their opportunity as well, all the other races joined the rebellion and the days of the Utraean domination of Aranna was over. Faced with overwhelming forces from both within & without, the Utraeans died by their thousands. Many Utraeans even died under their own weapons as they sought to defeat the menace under their own feet.\n\nThe fate of the surviving Utraeans was never properly established. It is rumoured that the last High Council of the Utraeans were exiled by their own people for allowing such a disaster. Also it is rumoured that many survivors fled to a remote Island where is said that time stands still. Some also say that the Utraeans vowed to have ultimate revenge on all of Aranna for the injustices dealt to them.

All we need to do is find the plughole at the bottom of the swamp and pull it out. Once the swamp is drained we can run around on the surface without getting our feet wet. You'd think with our intellect we could design a proper pair of gumboots, but no Goblin has every been successful. With this done, Lang and Elddim will fall under our domination.\n\nPart three of the plan is to make the sun hotter by building a massive fan to blow on it. With the Sun hotter, the snow around Fallraen will melt and we can invade it without getting a Cold.\n\nPart four of the plan is to build a massive aqueduct to take the melting snow from Fallraen into the Endless Desert, so that grass will grow there once again. This is so our feet won't get scorched by the hot desert sand as, you guessed it, we haven't been able to design a proper pair of sandals either.

The Humanoids, grey skinned, cowardly, skinny beings that liked to be called Utraeans, the Elves, wise and benevolent lovers of nature, who liked to tend to their trees & forests, not meddling in the affairs of others, Dwarves, short and stocky lovers of holes & burrows, who endlessly dug deeper and deeper, and always uncovering things best left undisturbed, and the mighty and majestic Half-Giants, strong and noble, defenders of law and order.\n\nNative to a mystic Island of the coast of the Peninsula, the Half-Giants lived long and prosperous lives, full of bravery and glory, never interfering in the affairs of others but always willing to come to the aid of those less fortunate than them. Their womenfolk especially were much admired by others as the testament of sheer beauty and compassion. Content to tend to their gardens and fields, they left all the decision making to the men who were more interested in the affairs of outsiders than they were. Indeed it was extremely rare to see the womenfolk of the Half-Giants outside of their home Island, which lead many to believe the Half-Giants to have no womenfolk.\n\nAs time past, the Utraeans came into their power and the other races came under their yoke. It seemed strange that the most inferior race would thus take control, but the Utraeans had something that the other races lacked. Content to live thus, the Half-Giants withdrew within themselves and fled to their Island. Eventually however the dominion of the Utraeans was such that the other races were compelled to act.\n\nIn a matter of a few short weeks, the Utraean Empire was destroyed, as much as from within as from without through the efforts of the other three races. However the cost was massive, even more than first thought. It wasn't until some time after the end of the War that it was discovered that the Utraeans had unleashed their greatest and most evil weapon! A genetically altered virus that attacks the Y-chromosomes of all races with differing results. It became obvious that the Utraeans had been working on this weapon for a long time, trying to perfect it and only released it when it became obvious that the War had been lost.n\n\Minor races like the Goblins, Seck & Droog were spared from any effects. However the effects on the main races was quite extreme. The Dwarves had their intellect impaired so that they lost the ability to create the wondrous machines of which they are famous for. Now their past glories can only be seen in the inferior mechanizations of the Goblins. The Elves slowly became infertile as only females were born and male Elves became very rare. This took millennia as Elves are extremely long lived but alas not immortal. The Utraeans weren't spared as the survivors became pale imitations of the original Utraeans. They lost their knowledge and power but gained piety for others, and eventually forgot all of their previous glories and atrocities.\n\nThe worst effected race was the Half-Giants. Females were born infertile or twisted ugly effigies of their former beautiful selves. In a cruel irony, new born males were given extremely long lives, rivalling that of the Elves, as if to torment them about what they had lost. Many male Half-Giants became hermits, explorers or wanderers, as if by running away from their heritage they could forget about what they lost, even if for a little while. This may have been a blessing for they escaped the madness that struck their homeland. As if they could no longer suffer to watch the eternal reminder of the beauty they're been deprived of, the male Half-Giants struck down their remaining womanfolk and thus lost their dignity and damned their race forever.";
